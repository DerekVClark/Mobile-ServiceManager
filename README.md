- How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Throughout my time in this course I have developed the necessary skills to thuroughly and effectively test my code by writing jUnit tests and validation tests to test that my code is functioning how I intended for it to function.
I also learned how to write error handeling responses to allow the user to identify where they are inserting invalid credentials like name, address, phone number etc... After writing my unit tests I utilize the eclipse coverage as tool to identify
how many instructions are handeled by my code ensuring efficient and correct responses to user input. This tool also allows me to identify to what percantage is my code being executed and thurouhgly covered through the jUnit tests I have developed
ensuring that my code is functional and secure. Through validation and error handeling I am able to prevent users with malicious intent from disrupting the flow of my program by inserting invalid characters and responses in the input fields
in which my program would not udnerstand how to response and executed exceptions to send messags back to users who may have inserted an invalid input.

- How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret user needs and incorporate them into my program throughout the entire development process I do this by first taking the time to identify the requirements figuring out what my codes needs to do, the type of users who are going to use my software,
and how my software should incorporate user input. Once I succesfully identify the requirements needed for the software at its final stages I can start to develop checking off each requirement after it has been implemented and thuroughly tested to ensure
maximum efficiecy and error handeling.

- How do I approach designing software?
My software desing approach is very user focused for ths software being developed is going to be used by the end user to solve some sort of problem they are having or offer solutions to problems they didnt even know they had. Through my very user centric
approach I am able to identify areas in which I need to pay a particular amount of focus on to prevent the end user from having a bad user experience, I also like to remain very heavily focused on fulfilling all the requirements provided to me or identified
by me to ensure that many different user scenarios are dealt with accurately and correltly.
